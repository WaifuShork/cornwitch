Welcome to Camilla. This is a story about a young witch, on a journey to go to the store and buy corn.

    It's mid summer, sometime in July. Camilla's mother asked if she would make a trip to the store.

Camilla reluctantly sighed before agreeing to her mothers request: "What is it you need from the store?"
    -she asked her mother in as polite of tone as possible-

Her mother returned happily: "We're all out of corn, I was hoping you could fetch a few kilos worth!"
    -in such a chiming tone-

Camilla noted down her mothers request and began to get ready to leave for the house.
